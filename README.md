#Clustering-Antarctic-Penguin-Species

Arctic Penguin Exploration: Unraveling Clusters in the Icy Domain with K-means clustering




A team of researchers who have been collecting data about penguins in Antartica!

Origin of this data : Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

The dataset consists of 5 columns.

culmen_length_mm: culmen length (mm)
culmen_depth_mm: culmen depth (mm)
flipper_length_mm: flipper length (mm)
body_mass_g: body mass (g)
sex: penguin sex
Unfortunately, they have not been able to record the species of penguin, but they know that there are three species that are native to the region: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo, so  task is to apply  data science skills to help them identify groups in the dataset!
